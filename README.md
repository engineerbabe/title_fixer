# title_fixer.py
A UTF-8 decoder that changes file names of a specified extension within a specified directory. 

My motivation behind creating this script was to avoid having to manually change downloaded mp3 file names. It was really annoying when they were downloaded and stored with UTF-8 encoding and looked crazy in my music player or my DJ software. 

To use this, clone this repo to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/engineerbabe/title_fixer
```

Go into the title_fixer directory, and start the title_fixer script:
```
./title_fixer.py
```

The script will ask the user for the following inputs: 
* The directory where the files are stored
* Confirmation of the directory chosed
* The extension of the files that need to be changed

Happy File Handling! :tada::tada::tada:
